    "In this lab, we'll use some simulated data to explore the structure of atomic and molecular spectra and learn how we can use knowledge of these spectra to determine chemical composition of unknown substances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is inspired by a method of finding pollutants in clouds. A high-power laser is fired into a cloud, exciting electrons and molecules. As these systems relax to their equilibrium states, they emit characteristic radiation which is used to determine the concentration of certain elements.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "In today's lab, we'll focus on a mixture of two ficticious atoms A and B. Each of the these atoms forms diatomic molecules ($A_2$ and $B_2$) at room temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by studying their spectra to determine some properties of each atom (and molecule). Then, we'll turn our attention to an unknown mixture of the two elements and use a measurement of the spectra of emitted by the gas to determine the relative concentrations of $A$ and $B$.\n",

    "### Characterizing $A$ and $B$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by imagining we are in a lab setting and can take a clear measurement of the spectra emitted by $A$ and $B$ seperately. They will be shown below.\n",

    "* What is the natural frequency ($\\omega$) of the bond between the atoms in the diatomic molecules ($A_2$ and $B_2$)?\n",
    "* What is the the moment of intertia ($I$) of each of the diatomic molecules?\n",

    "as we discussed, this will produce transitions with\n",
